## **Project Overview**  

The **Multithreaded Chat Application** is a **real-time client-server communication system** designed to allow multiple users to send and receive messages simultaneously over a network. This project was developed as part of **CODTECH Internship Task 3**, requiring the implementation of a **Java-based chat system** using **Sockets and Multithreading**.  

The primary objective of this project is to enable multiple clients to connect to a **centralized server**, exchange messages in real-time, and maintain an efficient, synchronized communication channel. The application was built and executed in **IntelliJ IDEA**, ensuring a well-structured and smooth development workflow.

## **Technology Stack**  

- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Networking**: Java Sockets (TCP Protocol)  
- **Multithreading**: Java Threading for handling multiple clients  
- **Development Environment**: IntelliJ IDEA

## **Project Workflow in IntelliJ IDEA**  

### **Step 1: Running the Chat Server**  

1. Created the **ChatServer.java** file to manage client connections.  
2. Initialized a **ServerSocket** to listen for incoming client requests on **port 12345**.  
3. When a client connects, the server assigns a **separate thread** to manage the connection.  
4. Maintained a list of **active clients** to ensure messages can be sent to all connected users.  
5. Continuously received messages from clients and broadcasted them to everyone.  

#### **Execution in IntelliJ IDEA (Server Output)**

- The **server successfully started**, accepted multiple client connections, and displayed received messages.

### **Step 2: Running the Chat Client**  

1. Created the **ChatClient.java** file to allow users to connect to the server.  
2. The client establishes a connection to the server at **localhost:12345**.  
3. A **separate thread** is launched to listen for incoming messages from the server while enabling the user to type and send messages.  
4. Messages entered by the user are sent to the **server**, which then distributes them to all other connected clients.  
5. The client continuously listens for messages from the server and displays them in real time.  

#### **Execution in IntelliJ IDEA (Client Output - Client )**

- The **client successfully connected** to the chat server and participated in real-time communication.

## **Key Features Implemented**  

**Real-time Messaging** – Clients can send and receive messages instantly.  
**Multithreading Support** – The server efficiently handles multiple clients simultaneously.  
**Message Broadcasting** – Messages from one client are sent to all other connected clients.  
**Efficient Connection Handling** – Smooth communication without lag or crashes.  

---

## **Challenges Faced & Solutions**  

### **1. Handling Multiple Clients Concurrently**  
- **Issue**: Managing multiple users sending and receiving messages simultaneously.  
- **Solution**: Implemented **multithreading**, where each client runs on an independent thread.  

### **2. Synchronizing Messages Across Clients**  
- **Issue**: Ensuring all connected users receive messages at the same time.  
- **Solution**: Used **synchronized broadcasting** to distribute messages efficiently.  

### **3. Handling Client Disconnections**  
- **Issue**: If a client disconnected unexpectedly, it caused issues in message delivery.  
- **Solution**: Implemented **error handling** to remove inactive clients from the active list.

## **Enhancements for Future Development**  

🔹 **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** – Improve usability by replacing the command-line interface.  
🔹 **User Authentication** – Implement a **login system** for added security.  
🔹 **File Sharing** – Enable **file transfers** within the chat system.  
🔹 **Private Messaging** – Allow users to send **direct messages** to specific participants.

## **Conclusion**  

The **Multithreaded Chat Application** successfully met the **CODTECH Task 3** requirements by implementing **real-time communication** using **Java Sockets and Multithreading**. The execution in **IntelliJ IDEA** ensured a well-structured and efficient development process.  

This project reinforced key **network programming concepts** and highlighted the importance of **multithreading** for handling multiple clients in parallel. The chat system efficiently managed real-time interactions, making it a **scalable and stable** solution for multi-user communication.
